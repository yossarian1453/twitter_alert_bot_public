# twitter_alert_bot_public
- For those interested in building their own twitter bot that retweets, captures and stores specific tweets

- If you're only wanting to retweet specific tweets, then you really only need the retweet script.

- If you're wanting to store the tweets, then setting up a SQL database is worthwhile.

- I set this up on a raspberry pi so I didn't have to leave my main computer on 24/7 as the raspberry pi uses
crontab to automate this bot
